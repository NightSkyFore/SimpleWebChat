SimpleWebChat

    This is a NodeJs implementation of web chat server, with simple usage of session cookie
and login auth.

Require npm package:
	express
	pug
	express-session
	body-parser
	multer
	sqlite3
	bluebird
	nodejs-websocket

All packages are the latest stable version.

besides:
	I use the lastest version of jquery and bootstrap for UI, which may have some problem with older version.

To start a server, run:
	node expressServer.js

then you will get the server running under port 3000(http) and 3001(websocket),
you could change them to any ports in file expressServer.js as you like.
